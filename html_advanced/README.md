# HTML Advanced – Web Development Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of the **ALU Web Development track**.  
The main goal is to **recreate a webpage from a Figma design file**.  

For this first step, we are focusing on **HTML semantic structure only**:  
✅ No CSS  
✅ No style rules  
✅ Pure, clean, accessible **HTML5**  

The purpose of this exercise is to build a **well-structured foundation** of the webpage, which will later be enhanced with styling and interactivity.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand and apply **semantic HTML5 tags**.  
- Translate a **Figma design file** into a correct HTML structure.  
- Practice **clean coding conventions** (indentation, nesting, readability).  
- Build a strong foundation for future styling with CSS and interactivity with JavaScript.
